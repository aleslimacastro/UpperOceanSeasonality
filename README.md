Key Points
----------

  - Upper-ocean submesoscale (10-100 km) turbulence and inertia-gravity waves undergo strong seasonal cycles that are out of phase.
  - Submesoscale turbulence dominates the horizontal velocity and sea-surface height variability in late winter/early spring.
  - Submesoscale inertia-gravity waves dominate the horizontal velocity and sea-surface height variability in late summer/early fall.

Abstract
--------
Recent studies show that the vigorous seasonal cycle of the mixed layer modulates
upper-ocean submesoscale turbulence.
Here we provide model-based evidence that the seasonally-changing upper-ocean
stratification in the Kuroshio Extension also modulates submesoscale (here 10-100 km)
inertia-gravity waves. Summertime re-stratification weakens submesoscale
turbulence but enhances inertia-gravity waves near the surface. Thus,
submesoscale turbulence and inertia-gravity waves undergo vigorous out-of-phase
seasonal cycles. These results imply a strong seasonal modulation of
the accuracy of geostrophic velocity diagnosed from submesoscale
sea-surface height delivered by the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT)
satellite mission.

Code
----
The analysis for this paper has been performed on NASA's [Pleiades Supercomputer](http://www.nas.nasa.gov/hecc/resources/pleiades.html). The project uses two small pieces of code developed by the first author and available on github:  [llctools](https://github.com/crocha700/llctools) and [pyspec](https://github.com/pyspec/pyspec). Those codes leverage on the [Scientific
Python stack](https://www.scipy.org/install.html). Specific processing and plotting codes are available on Jupyter [notebooks](https://github.com/crocha700/UpperOceanSeasonality/blob/master/notebooks/index.ipynb).

Once the heavy computations are performed on Pleiades and the output files are saved in netCDF4, the whole subsequent processing and plotting and LaTeX compiling
is performed in a single-button reproducible workflow using [nbflow](https://github.com/jhamrick/nbflow).  The draft is built online and
published using [gh-puslisher](https://github.com/ewanmellor/gh-publisher).

Data
------
The LLC outputs can be obtained from the [ECCO project](http://ecco2.org/llc\_hires).
The gridded altimeter data were produced by Ssalto/Duacs and distributed by
[AVISO](http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/duacs/), with support from CNES. The Argo
Roemmich-Gilson climatology can be downloaded from the [SIO Argo group](http://sio-argo.ucsd.edu/RG_Climatology.html). KEO mooring data are available
from [NOAA PMEL](http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/ocs/KEO). KESS mooring data are available
from the [US KESS project](http://uskess.whoi.edu/?page_id=406).
